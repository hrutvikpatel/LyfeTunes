						<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
							I want to inform you that whenever you
							use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
							I collect data and information (through third party
							products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
							include information such as your device Internet Protocol
							(“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
							configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
							the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
							statistics.
						</p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
							Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
							commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
							to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
							stored on your device's internal memory.

							This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
							the app may use third party code and libraries that use
							“cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
							You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
							and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
							choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
							portions of this Service.
						</p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
							I may employ third-party companies and
							individuals due to the following reasons:
						</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on
								our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To
								assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
							I want to inform users of this Service
							that these third parties have access to your Personal
							Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
							them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
							disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
						</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
							I value your trust in providing us your
							Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
							acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
							of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
							storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
							guarantee its absolute security.
						</p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
							This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
							a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
							that these external sites are not operated by me.
							Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
							Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
							no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
							privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
							services.

							These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.

						</p> <p>
							Hrutvik Patel is committed to ensuring that the app is

							The LyfeTunes app stores and processes personal data that

							phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
							compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean

							You should be aware that there are certain things that
							Hrutvik Patel will not take responsibility for. Certain
							functions of the app will require the app to have an active
							internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
							by your mobile network provider, but Hrutvik Patel
							cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
							functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
							have any of your data allowance left.
						</p> <p></p> <p>
							If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
							should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
							mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
							be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
							the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
							other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
							responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
							charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
							(i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
							you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
							using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
							received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
						</p> <p>
							Along the same lines, Hrutvik Patel cannot always take
							responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
							make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
							battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
							Hrutvik Patel cannot accept responsibility.
						</p> <p>
							With respect to Hrutvik Patel’s responsibility for your
							use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
							bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
							updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
							to provide information to us so that we can make it available
							to you. Hrutvik Patel accepts no liability for any
							loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
							relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
						</p> <p>
							At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
							currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
							both systems(and for any additional systems we
							decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
							and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
							using the app. Hrutvik Patel does not promise that it
							will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
							and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
							installed on your device. However, you promise to always

							also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
